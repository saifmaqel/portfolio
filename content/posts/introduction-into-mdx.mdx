## Building Interactive Posts with MDX

MDX lets you combine **Markdown** syntax with **React components** so you can create rich, interactive blog posts.

### What is MDX?

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com) is a format that blends Markdown and JSX.  
In a Next.js project, it allows you to:

- Write your posts or docs in Markdown syntax.
- Drop in interactive React components (like charts, callouts, or buttons).
- Keep all your content versioned and portable like normal Markdown files.

It’s especially popular for documentation sites, blogs, and component libraries.

### MDX in Next.js

Next.js supports MDX through libraries like [`next-mdx-remote`](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) or [`@next/mdx`](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx).  
Using these tools you can:

- Parse `.mdx` files at build time.
- Extract front matter for SEO or metadata.
- Render your Markdown with custom React components at runtime.

Here’s what we’ll cover next:

- What MDX is
- Why it’s powerful
- Example components inside MDX
