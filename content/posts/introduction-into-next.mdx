## Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful **React framework** for building fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications.  
It adds features like file-system routing, server-side rendering, and static site generation on top of React.

### What is Next.js?

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is an open-source framework created by Vercel.  
It enhances the developer experience by providing:

- **File-based routing:** Pages are created simply by adding files to the `pages/` directory.
- **Pre-rendering:** Built-in support for Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR).
- **API routes:** Build backend endpoints directly inside your Next.js project.
- **Image Optimization:** Automatic image resizing and lazy loading.

It’s especially useful for building marketing sites, blogs, dashboards, and full-stack applications.

### Why Use Next.js?

Next.js takes care of many performance and deployment concerns out of the box:

- **SEO-friendly pages** thanks to server-side rendering and meta tags.
- **Improved performance** with automatic code splitting.
- **Easy deployment** to Vercel or any Node-based host.
- **Built-in support** for CSS Modules, Sass, and popular styling libraries.
