### Overview

**The Spider Game** is an AI-powered game inspired by classic **snake mechanics**.  
Players control an ant that moves across a board while avoiding a spider that moves like a chess knight.  
The game demonstrates pathfinding algorithms in a fun and interactive way.

- **Platform:** Python with **Pygame** for graphics and game logic.
- **Algorithms:** Implemented **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, and **3 A\*** heuristics.
- **Gameplay:** Interactive spider chasing simulation with dynamic decision-making.
- **Learning Focus:** Demonstrates AI pathfinding and search algorithm behavior visually.

### Achievements / Highlights

- Built a fully playable **AI-powered game** with Python and Pygame.
- Implemented multiple **search algorithms** for dynamic spider movement.
- Designed a **grid-based board** to simulate chess-like moves for the spider.
- Created **visual feedback** to understand AI decision-maki
