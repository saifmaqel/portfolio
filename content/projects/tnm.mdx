### Overview

**Telecommunication Network Manager (TNM)** is a next-generation **web-based SaaS GIS platform** built to replace **Esri ArcGIS Pro** for telecom network planning and engineering.  
It enables admins and engineers to model, build, and manage end-to-end network infrastructure directly in a modern web application.

This has been my **primary and largest project**, and I have been developing and expanding it for **over 1.5 years**—leading core modules, implementing major features, and shaping its architecture.

### Teklabz Telco Network Manager

Teklabz **Telco Network Manager (TNM)** is a **web-based application built on the ArcGIS Utility Network framework**, specifically designed to support **telecom business processes** such as:

- **Order to Activation (O2A)**
- **Plan to Build (P2B)**
- **Trouble to Resolve (T2R)**

TNM offers users a **modernized and secure system** for creating, editing, analyzing, and sharing network information.

The solution employs a **versatile data model** that contains comprehensive information about telco assets, including:

- **Infrastructure network elements** like manholes, ducts, and cabinet structures.
- **Telco network components** like cables, patch panels, and ports.
- Efficiently manages **low-level connections and relationships** between these assets, ensuring full visibility of telco network connectivity.

### Tech & Integration

- **Frontend:** Developed using **TypeScript**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **React Hook Form**, **TanStack Query**, **AG Grid**, and custom hooks/components.
- **GIS Integration:** Integrated **ArcGIS JavaScript API** and other **GIS APIs** as third-party services to power web-based mapping and analysis.
- **Portal & Services:** Leveraged **ArcGIS Portal** and **ArcGIS Server Services** for secure data hosting, map services, and utility network operations.

### Achievements / Highlights

- Built and led core modules: **Work Orders**, **Feature Sketching & Editing**, **Mass Deletion**, **Inventory Browser**, **Model Palette**, **Association Editor**, **Connectivity Manager**, **Tracing Tools**, **Print Layout**, **Saved Maps**, **Admin**, and **Model Builder**.
- Collaborated closely with **backend and QA team members** in an **Agile environment** to drive feature delivery, coordinate releases, and ensure quality.
- Solved **complex operations** like feature deletion and large-scale child/associated feature removal by designing and discussing solutions with the team.
- Successfully integrated **ArcGIS Portal** and **ArcGIS Server Services** for seamless third-party GIS data and services consumption.
- Acted as the **main developer from the early stages**, helping bring the product to life and drive it forward through multiple releases.
- Delivered **deployments for international customers**, including custom features and configurations to allow them to test, evaluate, and adopt the platform.
- Added numerous **customer-specific features and customizations** to meet different telecom operators’ workflows and compliance requirements.
- Contributed to **continuous improvement** of the platform’s performance, security, and scalability to support production deployments.
