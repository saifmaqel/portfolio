### Overview

**Library Management System** is a full-stack web application for managing books, users, and borrowing activities in a library environment.  
It showcases deep integration between **Next.js App Router**, **NextAuth v5**, **Drizzle ORM**, and **PostgreSQL (Neon Serverless)** — ensuring type safety, scalability, and modern UX.

- **Database:** Schema-safe **Drizzle ORM** with **PostgreSQL** on **Neon Serverless**.
- **Data Grids:** Implemented **AG Grid React v34** for dynamic and performant data tables.
- **Forms:** Used **React Hook Form + Zod** for type-safe validation.
- **UX Enhancements:** Used **Sonner** for feedback toasts and **Upstash Workflows** for background jobs.
