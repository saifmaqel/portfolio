### Overview

The main purpose of this project is to implement a **100% secure authentication and authorization system** using a dual-token strategy:

- **Refresh token** stored securely in **HTTP-only cookies**.
- **Access token** managed safely within the app state using **Redux**.

The app ensures that all sensitive operations are protected against XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities, and user roles (Admin, Manager, Employee) determine access to specific routes and API endpoints.

### Achievements / Highlights

- Implemented **secure dual-token authentication** (HTTP-only refresh + Redux access token).
- Developed **protected routes and endpoints** with **role-based authorization**.
- Built a **full-stack MERN application** following best practices for session and token management.
- Structured the frontend using **React**, **Redux**, and **React Router** for maintainable state and navigation handling.
- Ensured **API security** using Express middleware for token verification and access control.
- Followed **industry-standard security and REST API design** principles for reliability and scalability.
- Designed a **responsive and modular UI** with a focus on simplicity and reusability.
