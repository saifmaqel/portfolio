### Overview

**Fiber Assignment System (FAS)** is a web-based application designed to record, design, and manage fiber assignments and reservations for **STC Saudi** using **Ericsson** infrastructure systems.  
The platform streamlines network planning and operations with a responsive UI, efficient data handling, and seamless backend integration.

- **Frontend:** Built with **React**, **Mantine Core**, **TanStack Query**, **AG Grid**, **Axios**, **React Router**, and **Zustand**.
- **Backend:** Integrated selected endpoints in **.NET Core** with **Oracle Database**.
- **Functionality:** Supports fiber assignment management, network planning, and reservation tracking, including **complex forms for creating, editing, and viewing cables and fiber reservations (RN)**.
- **Scalability:** Optimized to handle complex telecom datasets efficiently.

### Achievements / Highlights

- Developed **80% of the frontend**, implementing interactive grids, forms, dashboards, and **complex forms for cable and RN management**; implemented a few backend endpoints in .NET Core with Oracle Database.
- Collaborated with backend and QA teams to define **data structures for complex telecom datasets**.
- Implemented responsive **UI components** and reusable **React hooks** for maintainability.
- Improved **workflow efficiency** by automating repetitive tasks and standardizing data input.
- Ensured **high reliability and scalability** for large telecom network datasets.
- Implemented a secure authentication system using access tokens and refresh tokens to protect API communication and user sessions.
