### Overview

The **Titanic ML Project** involved exploring, cleaning, and modeling the famous **Titanic dataset** to predict passenger survival.  
The project demonstrates practical machine learning techniques using **Python** and popular data science libraries, emphasizing predictive modeling, data preprocessing, and evaluation metrics.

- **Data Handling:** Used **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Visualization:** Applied **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to understand data patterns.
- **Machine Learning:** Built models with **scikit-learn**, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Evaluation:** Measured performance using **accuracy** and **F1-score** metrics.

### Achievements / Highlights

- Explored and cleaned real-world dataset for predictive analysis.
- Implemented multiple **machine learning models** to compare performance.
- Developed **data visualizations** to interpret feature importance and patterns.
- Evaluated models with **reliable metrics** and identified the best-performing algorithm.
- Structured project for **reproducibility and learning**, including modular code and documentation.
